    "Through our preliminary analysis from CDC data, we investigated cities with high asthma rates. We discovered that Cleveland, Ohio resulted in the highest percentage of adults with asthma in the United States in 2017. Knowing that increasing Air Quality Index (AQI) can negatively impact people with respiratory illensses, we wanted to evaluate the realtionship with air pollutants, temperature, day of the week, and month to see if we could identify any relationship to overall daily air quality data (from the EPA website).\n",

We also recommend local and state governments to implement stricter anti-pollution measures to accomodate better Air Quality for their citizens."

    "While not perfect, what we have started with has given a solid foundation to improve upon. The Nueral Net model created has the potential to become better with more data, and with the possibility of using data that includes extreme conditions, whether hypothetical or factual. As with many other models, collecting more data to train our model would likely show an improvement, and there is plenty of data to use for this topic, both within the features investigated, as well as looking for new features to incorporate.\n",
    "\n",

    "A constraint we encountered was the limitation of storage and computing power when deploying our model within a Streamlit app to Heroku. As a free online deployment tool, Heroku allowed us to get our app deployed, but with an amount of difficulty that would not be encountered if Hosted with a cloud service like EC2 with Amazon Web Services."

    "Another way to add more to our research would involve taking pollutant readings from websites and RSS feeds in realtime to help add information to our model, as well as sending it to our Streamlit application for ease of use. This process can even be automated on an EC2 instance with a time-based job-scheduler like cron-job.\n",
